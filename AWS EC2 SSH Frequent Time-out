Solution:

## Remote into your EC2 instance:

ssh -i <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE>.pem <INTERNET_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_INSTANCE>

## Add a "client-alive" directive to the instance's SSH-server configuration file:

echo 'ClientAliveInterval 60' | sudo tee --append /etc/ssh/sshd_config

## Restart or reload the SSH server, for it to recognize the configuration change:

## The command for that on Ubuntu Linux would be:

sudo systemctl restart ssh.service

## On any other Linux, though, the following is probably correct:

sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

## Disconnect:

logout

## The next time you SSH into that EC2 instance, those super-annoying frequent connection freezes/timeouts/drops should hopefully be gone.

## This is also helps with Google Compute Engine instances, which come with similarly annoying default settings.
